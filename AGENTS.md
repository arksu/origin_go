- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever complexity
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Extract repeated logic into reusable functions/classes/modules
- Write self-documenting code: Use clear variable/function names that explain intent
- Fail fast: Validate inputs early and throw meaningful errors
- Single Responsibility: Each function/class should do one thing well

- Comment WHY, not WHAT (code shows what, comments explain reasoning)
- Handle errors explicitly; avoid silent failures
- Use meaningful variable names (no 'x', 'tmp', 'data' without context)
- Keep configuration separate from code
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use appropriate data structures (dict for lookups, set for uniqueness)
- Consider time/space complexity for large datasets
- Cache expensive computations when appropriate
- Use lazy evaluation for large collections
